               <p>The hotel has 550 guest rooms and houses the largest pillar-less convention hall in New Delhi, where the iconic Dehlvi family hosted the Shama-Sushama Film Awards every year through the mid-twentieth century. Situated in the Chanakyapuri diplomatic enclave, it neighbors the official residence of the prime minister of India and the British High Commission. It has hosted several royals and heads of state, including Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Aga Khan, Tito, Margaret Thatcher, President Bill Clinton, Che Guevara, and Fidel Castro. The presidential suite was used for three years as the official residence of the Saudi Arabian ambassador.

The hotel is owned by ITDC, of which the Government of India owns an 87.03% stake.The hotel is named after emperor Ashoka The Great, who had conquered almost the entirety of the Indian subcontinent from c.â€‰268 to 232 BCE</p>

        <p>Great location, easy to get in and out of the city. The staff was wonderful. The hotel is well maintained. The beds were very firm, too firm for my liking. The food was good. I, especially, enjoyed the view of the sunset.</p>
